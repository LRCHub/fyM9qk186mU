I'm amazed and a little fazed
By what passes for wit these days
I'm not crazy about the trash they praise
Or the flags they wave these days

I'm amazed and a little fazed
By the drugs they crave these days
That's just the way it plays
It's a masquerade these days

I'm a man out of time
Until the stars realign
With taste so refined
I don't know which way we're heading

I'm a man out of time
With a mountain to climb
Just looking for a sign
Do you know which way we go?

I'll ask the boy that I once was
About the man that I've become
About the days and days and days gone by
And the night still yet to come

That boy would turn to me and say
You're not the only one
When all said and done
Our future's looking brighter than the sun

I'm amazed and little fazed
By the way love stays today
By the facts that they portray
In a lover's gaze today

I'm amazed and a little fazed
By the things you say to me
By the faith you place in me
And all that we can truly be

I'm a man out of time
Until the stars realign
With taste so refined
I don't know which way we're heading

I'm a man out of time
Trapped in rewind
Just looking for a sign
Do you know which way to go?

I'll ask the boy that I once was
About the man that I've become
About the days and days and days gone by
And the night still yet to come

That boy would turn to me and say
You're not the only one
When all said and done
Our future's looking brighter than the sun

I'll ask the boy that I once was
About the man that I've become
About the days and days and days gone by
And the night still yet to come

That boy would turn to me and say
You're not the only one
When all said and done
Our future's looking brighter than the sun

When all said and done
Our future's looking brighter than the sun

Our future's looking brighter than the sun

When all said and done
Our future's looking brighter than the sun
