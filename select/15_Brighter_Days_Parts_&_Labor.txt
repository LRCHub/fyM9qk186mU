I went away to see some friends that i had made
Back in brighter days
They had not aged they just found a very cozy cage
And that was where they stayed
The sunlight barely carved its way into the room
The windows painted on the walls
And i found no answers
No cures no cancers
No path no brighter way

Uninvited guests in our heads best arrested
Questioning our time
Entertained to death
At best a peaceful unrest
Sleep with open eyes
I'll swim in hell and i will get to know it well
And all the birds will sing their song inside my cell
To a couch-bound scarecrow with a desk-bound stare so dense
Blow out the candles now

And when I stop to look
There's no more need for thoughts or books
Just a mouth and eyes
The dead connections fed the buzz and crackle in my head
Memorize your lines
