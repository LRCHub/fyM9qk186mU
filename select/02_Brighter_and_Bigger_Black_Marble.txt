It's a wonder your over, your over and back here again
Cause I wonder if you saw the green light, if you saw the green light?
It's a wonder your over, your over and back here again
Cause I wonder if you saw the green light, if you saw the green light?

Reading along,
Characters found,
Nothing to save them but shade on the ground
And you, you went to the river
Wondering down,
Old parade ground,
Ringing out louder than carnival sounds
The words, I had to deliver
Wander the halls,
Super thin walls, shifting my eyes around
All sun, can't miss all sun
Reading along while the characters found,
Nothing to save them but shade on the ground and you
Getting brighter and bigger
It's a wonder your over, your over and back here again
Cause I wonder if you saw the green light, if you saw the green light?
It's a wonder your over, your over and back here again
Cause I wonder if you saw the green light, if you saw the green light?
Wonder then walk,
Super thin walls, shifting my eyes around
All sun, don't miss all sun
Over just say,
With all our finds in the way,
Just see me awake,
I don't bruise anymore

See me awake

Reading along,
Prices are down,
People with money are out on the town
Can you remember the reason?
Paid for my things, down at the store,
Paid for my things and I walked out the door
Into cold, getting cold for the season
Wander then walk, super thin walls, shifting my eyes around
All sun, can't miss the sun
Turn over just say,
Brighter and bigger ok?
Just see me awake, I don't bruise anymore
