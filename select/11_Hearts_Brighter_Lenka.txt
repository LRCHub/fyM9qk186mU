You could spread your wings wide
And you could take to the skies
And maybe you would fall down
But it would be the best ride

You could take the deep plunge
Dive into the depths of
Anybody's ocean
'Cause everybody wants one

Hearts wilder than
Hearts stronger than
Hearts wiser than
Anything you ever thought you would be fighting for

Hearts bigger than
Hearts bolder than
Hearts brighter than
Anything you ever thought you would be fighting for

Anything you ever thought you would be fighting for

We could take the long road
And we could let it go slow
Open up a window
Take a breath, turn a page over

'Cause you've been trying so hard
Living with a bruised heart
But maybe you should let it open up a little
'Cause baby it's the best part

Hearts wilder than
Hearts stronger than
Hearts wiser than
Anything you ever thought you would be fighting for

Hearts bigger than
Hearts bolder than
Hearts brighter than
Anything you ever thought you would be fighting for

It grew a little every chance you took
It grew a little every stand you stood
It took a little but you knew it would
Our hearts are brighter than we ever knew

It grew a little every chance you took
It grew a little every stand you stood
It took a little but you knew it would
Our hearts are brighter than we ever knew

Hearts wilder than
Hearts stronger than
Hearts wiser than
Anything you ever thought you would be fighting for

Hearts bigger than
Hearts bolder than
Hearts brighter than
Anything you ever thought you would be fighting for

Anything you ever thought you would be fighting for

So hold your heart open and be ready for a little more, oh oh
It's everything we ever thought we would be fighting for

It's everything we ever thought we would be fighting for
So hold your heart open open and be ready for a little more

Everything we ever thought we would be fighting for

It's everything we ever thought we would be fighting for

Hold your heart open open and be ready for a little more
